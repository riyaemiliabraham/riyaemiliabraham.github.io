									<h1>Glad that  you're willing<br />
									to know more</h1>
									<p>As the gist meant ,<b>I'm an international master's student in Germany pursuing my MSc in Computer Science degree at University of Siegen</b>.
									   So far,I'm loving everything about my course and Germany.Ofc,It's overwhelming moving out of my homeland and being in a new country,but exploring new things is all that matters to me now! 
									</p>

								<p>Back in India ,I graduated my bachelor's course in Computer Science and Engineering in the year 2017 and took up a job at an MNC (TATA Consultancy Services).I was excited and still proud that I was a part of such a big organization and would always be grateful to my first job.I was an<b> Assistant system engineer trainee</b> and I was assigned to a project that mainly focused on providing <b>support with the SAP services of the international company HOMEDEPOT,US</b>.For two years,I got immense support and training as SAP functional support and was also given to handle individual configuration and support to be handled in the project.But,after 2 years,I felt that providing support was not that all I wanted.As a computer science student,I could foresee the opprotunities the IT industry was providing,which didn't want me to settle for the support services and at that moment I decided to pursue my masters and inculcate a deep understanding about the field and choose a role  among the pleothera of opportunities,that would be a good fit for me.  </p>
								
								<p>As a new start,I have <b>deep interest in web development</b> and I'm focusing on equipping myself with techonologies that would help be to become good developer and a mindset to adapt to the changing world of Web techonologies.Currently,I have worked using the three foundations<b> HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT</b> and pushing myself to learn other techonologies to <b>become a good  MERN developer</b>.I have built projects and somewhere during the journey I felt that I wanted to experience how a company goes about building a website,Personal projects were great and exciting but I beleive without colloboration my knowledge would go limited.Hence ,Currently I'm looking for an internship or workstudent jobs in Germany for a break into my new interest.</p>
